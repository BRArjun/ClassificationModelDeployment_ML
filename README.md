# Classification_Model_Deployment
This is a classification model that can be deployed to the web using Gradio

The model used here is Logistic Regression that can be used to classify binary or multiclass inputs
I have used the accuracy metric from sklearn.metrics that returns an accuracy of 91%.

I have used various other models like Neural Networks,Random Forest and Decision Trees to do this task but found that this is the best way to do it.

This model takes data from this [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) and predicts if the student is a Dropout or a Graduate.
