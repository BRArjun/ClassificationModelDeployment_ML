# Classification Model Deployment

Classification Model Deployment is a project that aims to deploy a classification model to the web using Gradio. The deployed model utilizes Logistic Regression to classify binary or multiclass inputs, specifically predicting whether a student is a Dropout or a Graduate based on academic data.

## Model Details

- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Objective:** Binary or multiclass classification to predict student dropout or graduation.
- **Performance Metric:** Accuracy, calculated using the accuracy metric from sklearn.metrics, which returns an accuracy of 91%.

## Model Comparison

Various other models, including Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Decision Trees, were experimented with for this task. However, Logistic Regression was found to be the most effective approach based on performance metrics and practical considerations.

## Data Source

The model takes data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success), which provides academic data for students. Features include academic performance, demographic information, and socioeconomic factors.

## Deployment

The model is deployed using Gradio, a simple library that allows for easy deployment of machine learning models as web applications. Users can input student data through a user-friendly interface and receive predictions on whether the student is likely to dropout or graduate.

## Conclusion

Classification Model Deployment showcases the use of Logistic Regression for predicting student dropout or graduation and demonstrates the ease of deploying such models to the web using Gradio. With an accuracy of 91%, the model provides valuable insights for educational institutions and policymakers in identifying at-risk students and implementing targeted interventions to improve student outcomes.
